The tags contain electronically stored information. Passive tags collect energy from a nearby RFID reader's interrogating radio waves. Active tags have a local power source such as a battery and may operate at hundreds of meters from the RFID reader. Unlike a barcode, the tag need not be within the line of sight of the reader, so it may be embedded in the tracked object. RFID is one method for Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC).","moduleName":"RFID","weekday":"Monday","openYear":"3","state":"current","beginTime":13,"endTime":15,"moduleId":"EBU0026","credit":2},{"score":0,"teacherEmail":"emilyd@quml.ac.uk","teacher":"Emily Davis","intro":"Wireless sensor networks (WSN), sometimes called wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSAN), are spatially distributed autonomous sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, pressure, etc. and to cooperatively pass their data through the network to a main location. The more modern networks are bi-directional, also enabling control of sensor activity. The development of wireless sensor networks was motivated by military applications such as battlefield surveillance; today such networks are used in many industrial and consumer applications, such as industrial process monitoring and control, machine health monitoring, and so on.","moduleName":"Wireless Sensor","weekday":"Tuesday","openYear":"3","state":"current","beginTime":10,"endTime":12,"moduleId":"EBU0027","credit":4}],"portfolios":[{"projectIntroduction":"this is a database design","fileLink":"inputFile/ERdiagram.png","projectName":"Design a Database for a manage system"},{"projectIntroduction":"An AI-powered chatbot.","fileLink":"inputFile/chatbot_demo_video.mp4","projectName":"Chatbot for Customer Support"},{"projectIntroduction":"The system enables customers to book tables online.","fileLink":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/XXXXXX","projectName":"Design a reservation system"}],"studentNo":"111","bulletin":[{"updateTime":"2021.05.20","notice":"Discrete math quiz will be held next Tuesday"}]}]
